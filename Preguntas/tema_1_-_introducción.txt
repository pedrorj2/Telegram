:: Introduction to Aircraft Design
:: The lift of the aircraft is a vertical force normal to {
=the upstream undisturbed flow
~the fuselage centre line
~the fuselage centre line in aircrafts and the upstream incidence flow in autogyros
}

// Pregunta 2
:: Introduction to Aircraft Design
:: The induced drag of an aircraft depends mainly on {
~%-100%the laminar or turbulent character of the boundary layer
~%50%the total lift coefficient
~%50%the wing shape
~%-100%the streamlined shape of the fuselage
}

// Pregunta 3
:: Introduction to Aircraft Design
:: A coordinate turn manuever is performed by using {
   ~Antisymmetric deflection of ailerons
   =Rotation of ailerons and rudder
   ~Rotation of ailerons and a particular flap setting
   ~Rotation of ailerons and spoilers
}

// Pregunta 4
:: Introduction to SD&A
:: Static Aeroelasticity does not consider inertia effects in the aeroelastic formulation. This means that {
=the deformation is static and no time-varying motion appears
~the weight is not considered into the formulation
~the weight can be included but no load factor associated to a particular maneuver
~the mass is assumed to be negligible when compared with the stiffness and aerodynamic terms
}

// Pregunta 5
:: Introduction to SD&A
:: The backward sweep angle in wings is prone to have less problems of {
=Divergence
~Control Reversal
~Flutter
~Buffet
}

// Pregunta 6
:: Introduction to SD&A
:: The location of the elastic axis depends on {
   ~%50%the thickness of the wing skin
   ~%-100%the location of the engines
   ~%-100%the normal mode involved in the flutter mechanism
   ~%50%the area of the front spar
}

// Pregunta 7
:: Introduction to SD&A
:: Buffeting is {
   =a response-type problem
   ~an aeroelastic instability
   ~always random in frequency
   ~an oscillatory vibration with amplitudes that depend exclusively of the external loads
}
