// Pregunta 1 (GIA,MUIA)
:: Dynamic Aeroelasticity
:: Aircraft flutter instability is usually associated to {
~the instability of one normal mode of the aircraft, typically torsion
~the instability of one normal mode of the aircraft, typically bending
~the coupling of two normal modes
=coupling of two or more normal modes
}
 
// Pregunta 2 (GIA,MUIA)
:: Dynamic Aeroelasticity
:: The flutter mechanism based on control surface rotation with wing bending is usually mitigated by {
~moving the centre of gravity of the control surface towards its trailing edge
=moving the centre of gravity of the control surface towards the hinge line
~increasing the weight of the control surface maintaining the position of its centre of gravity
}
 
// Pregunta 3 (GIA,MUIA)
:: Dynamic Aeroelasticity
:: The flutter mechanisms with relevant influence of the control surface rotation is avoided if {
~the centre of gravity of the control surface stays at the hinge line (100% balance condition)
~the centre of gravity is ahead of the hinge line, close to the leading edge of the control surface
~the centre of gravity of the control surface stays at the hinge line (100% balance condition) and at the mid position in the spanwise direction
=none of the previous answers are correct
}
 
// Pregunta 4 (GIA,MUIA)
:: Dynamic Aeroelasticity
:: The inertia definition in the aeroelastic model us usually performed by {
~%-100%declaring the density of the materials
~%50%concentrated masses, joined to the structure thru ad-hoc connections
~%50%both density-base and concentrated masses could be used depending on the assumptions in the model
}
 
// Pregunta 5 (MUIA)
:: Dynamic Aeroelasticity
:: The complete FEM (sometimes called GFEM, Global Finite Element Model) is directly used in flutter calculations {
~yes, it is better to use this model to assure sinergy with the Stress Office and the Fatigue Department, typical users of this model
=no, it is reduced in degrees of freedom and the DFEM is obtained for calculating the modal base
~depending on the flutter mechanism, the GEM can be used
}
 
// Pregunta 6 (MUIA)
:: Dynamic Aeroelasticity
:: The flutter solver based on the k-Method is {
~matched, with respect to the standard atmosphere
=unmatched, with respect to the standard atmosphere
~usually used for constant Mach calculations and density changing with the flight speed
}
 
// Pregunta 7 (GIA,MUIA)
:: Dynamic Aeroelasticity
:: Regulations state that the g=0 flutter condition must be {
~above the maximum operational flight speed VC and diving Mach number MD
~above the maximum operational flight speed VC and, preferrable, above the maximum diving speed VD
~above the maximum operational flight speed VC and, preferrable, above the factorized maximum diving speed 1.15xVD
=above the maximum operational flight speed VD and Mach number MD
